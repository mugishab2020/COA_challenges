# COA_challengeres
In this challenge we have a gallery webpage designed in plain HTML,CSS and Javascript
it doesn't need any installation or rules to run it 
You just open the HTML file inside the Gallery directory and see that Page

Secondly we have two wonderful challenges  which are written in Javascript
1. We have Array Manipulation. This challenge determine if there exists a contiguous
subarray within the array that sums up to the target

To run it we write the certain array , and the tartgetsum in the ArrayMap.js file  we use "node arrayMap.js" which returns if the  array have the contiguous array

1. We have String Transformation. This challenge transform it based on the following rules:
●
●
●
If the length of the string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.
If the length of the string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.
If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 15), perform
both operations in the order specified above.

To run it we write the certain string , in the stringTramsform.js file  we use "node stringTransform.js" which returns the corresponding string or array
